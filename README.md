# Supertelega
It's like Superhuman, but for your Telegram.

## Overview
Supertelega works in a similar way to how Superhuman works with your email - automatically archiving every chat with no unread messages every 30 seconds, with the exception of pinned chats. Now you can be focused!

<b>Moreover, spam messages that are forwarded from unknown contacts are archived!</b>
